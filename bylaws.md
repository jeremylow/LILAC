# Bylaws of LILAC

Adopted: 19 May 2019

## Article I. Purpose.

LILAC is organized exclusively to promote social welfare. LILAC seeks to build the multiracial, multi-gendered, and multigenerational working class movement necessary to win and wield the power necessary to build socialism and end all other forms of exploitation and oppression. LILAC shall do so by representing and fighting for socialist perspectives, strategies, and policies in progressive coalitions in Philadelphia, actively participant in leftist ones, and building  bridges to bring the two together into a popular front.

## Article II. Membership.

### Section 1. Eligibility

Any individual may apply for LILAC membership. A member is defined as anyone who:

* Pays monthly dues to the organization;
* Agrees with and works to uphold the values articulated in Article I; and
* Agrees to abide by LILAC’s Code of Conduct and Community Agreements.

Any members may resign their membership upon request.

### Section 2. Dues

Dues shall be set at a minimum of five dollars ($5.00) per month for the first six months of the organization’s existence and recalculated yearly thereafter. Dues waivers shall be granted upon request. 

## Article III. Bodies.

### Section 1. Working Groups.

Working Groups may be formed by any five members to pursue any goal in line with Article I, absent the disapproval of two-thirds of a General Meeting. Working Groups shall meet monthly and shall be open to all members of LILAC. Membership in a Working Group is defined as having attended two of the previous four monthly Working Group meetings. 

Working Groups may operate with the imprimatur of LILAC until they no longer have five members or two-thirds of a General Meeting votes to disband the Working Group. The membership may vote to block a specific action, tactic, or strategy upon a two-thirds majority at a General Meeting. A disbanded Working Group shall wait for three months before attempting to re-form a new Working Group with a substantially similar goal. 

### Section 2. General Meeting.

1. **Powers**. The General Meeting shall set LILAC’s priorities, and take any other actions it deems appropriate in accordance with these bylaws, and federal and state law. Working Groups shall submit a list of planned actions for that month. The General Meeting shall first vote on whether to disband any new Working Groups or block any specific proposed action of any Working Groups. Any such vote shall require a two-thirds majority to pass. The General Meeting shall then use Rusty’s Rules of Order to prioritize up to 3 of the approved Working Group actions.

2. **Participatory Budgeting**. The General Meeting shall approve LILAC’s quarterly budget in accordance with its understanding of LILAC’s priorities. Working Groups shall submit a quarterly budget delineating its requested financial support two weeks prior to the General Meeting at which such financial resources are apportioned.

3. **Quorum**. Quorum for a General Meeting is 10% of LILAC’s membership.  

4. **Frequency**. General Meetings shall occur monthly.

### Section 3. Coordinating Committee

1. **Composition**. The Coordinating Committee shall be composed of one representative from each Working Group, elected by the Working Groups themselves for one year terms. A member can serve at most two consecutive terms (of any length). Working Groups may recall their representative and elect a new representative at any time. If a Working Group’s representative loses their membership or chooses to step down, the Working Group shall elect a new representative, whose one year term shall begin on the date of their election. <br><br> With the exception of those Working Groups extant at the ratification of these Bylaws, in order to be eligible to send a representative to the Coordinating Committee, a Working Group must remain active for two months after which it shall be eligible to send a representative to the Coordinating Committee.

2. **Duties**.
The Coordination Committee shall coordinate actions, strategies, and tactics across Working Groups and serve as the locus for LILAC’s efforts that cut across Working Groups. The Coordinating Committee is required to submit minutes of its meetings no later than one week after such meeting.

3. **Powers**. The Coordinating Committee may act with the imprimatur of the membership between General Meetings, but will defer to the General Meeting if time is not of the essence. Decisions of the Coordinating Committee shall be subject to ratification by the General Meeting.

4. **Recall**. The membership may recall a Working Group’s representative to the Coordinating Committee by simple majority vote at a General Meeting. A representative so recalled shall not be eligible to sit on the Coordinating Committee for one year.

### Section 4. Administrative Committee.

The Administrative Committee shall be the administrative body, and shall consist of the following roles: Treasurer, Space Coordinator, Agenda Coordinator, Membership Coordinator, and Outreach Coordinator. 

Upon ratification of these bylaws, and annually thereafter, members shall have one week to announce their candidacy and qualifications for the above roles. There shall then be a one week online voting process, using ranked choice voting for each role. A member may only serve in the same role for two consecutive terms, and may only be on the Administrative Administrative for 3 consecutive terms. If a member of the Administrative Committee steps down, or is recalled by a simple majority at a General Meeting, the above process for soliciting and voting on candidates shall be followed to elect a member to serve for the remainder of the term. 

#### Treasurer
The Treasurer shall collect monthly dues. Such collected monthly dues shall constitute the monthly budget and shall be transmitted to the Agenda Coordinator no later than one week before the General Meeting.

#### Space Coordinator
The Space Coordinator shall book a free and handicap accessible space for the General Meeting each month; and shall announce the time, date, and location of said meeting no later than two weeks prior to said Meeting. For the purposes of compliance with local, state, and federal law, the Space Coordinator shall also serve as the President of the corporation.

#### Agenda Coordinator
The Agenda Coordinator shall create the Meeting Packet, containing each Working Group’s submission, the monthly budget, and any and all written charges to be deliberated on that month; and shall publish it on LILAC’s website one week prior to the General Meeting.
